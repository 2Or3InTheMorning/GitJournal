    - title: Inline Tags
      text: By default now typing with '#feature' will mark the note with the 'feature' tag. As GitJournal is used in so many different ways, the inline tags prefix is quite configurable

  bugs:
    - title: Parse Maps in the YAML Frontmatter
      text: "Earlier they were being ignored. Unfortunately, the exact formatting of the map might not be preserved, as the YAML serializer still needs some work. Please vote on issue #239 to increase its priority"
    - title: Hide Notes which could not be parsed.
      text: "Those notes were still shown but in a mangled state. We now clearly hide those note. You can check the debug log to see which files are being ignored. The idea is to have a future File System View - #91 - where you can see all the files in a repo, along with the reason why some of them do not appear as Notes."

    - title: One Time Purchase

    - title: Zettelkasten filename format
      text: Allow notes to be saved with the 'yyyymmddmmhhss' format
  improvements:
    - title: Make Swipe to delete configurable
      text: Apparently, many users hate it and accidentally trigger it quite often.
    - title: Allow Markdown to be previewd from all Editors
      text: All of GitJournal's editors are compatible and operate on the same markdown file. Earlier you could only preview the rendered markdown when with the Markdown Editor.

      image: pro_tag.jpeg
  bugs:
    - title: Preserve Note title format
      text: Regardless of the settings, the note title should be saved in the same way it was read. Eg - If it was in the YAML metadata, it should be saved there.
